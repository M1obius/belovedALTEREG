“I don't know how someone could hate as much as him. To me, it seemed like ever since the day he was born, all he knew was to hate. To hate everything that could sigh, live and feel. Everything that he knew ever existed. It was like he had already been hurt. There was no innocence in that child. Only pure, ugly hatred. The metaphor for detestation. The embodiment of loathing.”
